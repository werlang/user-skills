# Audit Project Context

Use this skill to audit the current project's documentation and agent customization files against the actual implementation, then rewrite inaccurate sections so the context stays trustworthy.

## Covers

- `.github/**`
- `.agents/**`
- `.claude/**`
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`
- `docs/**/*.md`, `tasks/**/*.md`
- prompt, instruction, agent, skill, reference, and other markdown files related to project context

## Workflow

1. Read the in-scope docs and customization files first to understand the current documented state.
2. Research the actual implementation: runtime, services, routes, entities/models, config, env vars, scripts, infrastructure, tests, and deployment expectations.
3. Compare docs to code and record discrepancies with [the audit checklist](./references/audit-checklist.md).
4. Update inaccurate, stale, or incomplete files. Remove aspirational claims that are not enforced by code or tooling.
5. Sweep for terminology drift, broken links, missing files, and contradictory claims across docs.
6. Return the result using [the output template](./references/output-template.md).

## Rules

- Code and configuration are the source of truth.
- Do not preserve "should", "must", or "we have" language unless the repository actually enforces it.
- Keep accurate structure when useful, but rewrite incorrect technical details.
- If a doc references tooling, agents, or files that do not exist, fix or remove the reference.

## Required Checks

- Routes, commands, env vars, ports, and file paths are real.
- Skill descriptions and examples match actual workflows.
- Prompts and agents point to files and conventions that exist.
- README/setup steps are executable for the current project.
- Cross-file terminology is consistent for the same concepts.

## Output

Return:

- files updated
- key discrepancies fixed, removed, or added
- remaining implementation issues discovered during the audit
- confidence notes for terminology and consistency sweeps
