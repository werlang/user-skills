description: Codebase Search & Intelligence using SocratiCode. Use when exploring code structure, searching concepts, finding symbol usages, inspecting impact/blast radius before refactoring, tracing execution flows, checking circular dependencies, or searching non-code context artifacts. Automatically checks index status and triggers indexing if the project is not yet indexed.

# Codebase Search & Intelligence (SocratiCode)

Always use SocratiCode MCP tools to explore codebases before reading any files directly.

### Initial Prerequisites (On Any Project)

0. **Check Index Status First (`codebase_status`).**
   Before running searches or graph queries on a project, check if it is already indexed.
   - Run `codebase_status`.
   - **If not indexed or missing**: Call `codebase_index` immediately to start background indexing.
   - Poll `codebase_status` until progress reaches 100% before executing `codebase_search`.
   - Building the index also automatically constructs the AST dependency graph and symbol call table.

### Exploration & Analysis Workflow

1. **Start explorations with `codebase_search`.**
   Hybrid semantic + keyword search (vector + BM25, RRF-fused) runs in a single call.
   - Use broad, conceptual queries for orientation: "how is authentication handled",
     "database connection setup", "error handling patterns".
   - Use precise queries for symbol lookups: exact function names, constants, type names.
   - Prefer search results to infer which files to read — do not speculatively open files.
   - **When to use grep instead**: If you already know the exact identifier, error string,
     or regex pattern, grep/ripgrep is faster and more precise — no semantic gap to bridge.
     Use `codebase_search` when you're exploring, asking conceptual questions, or don't
     know which files to look in.

2. **Follow the graph before following imports.**
   Use `codebase_graph_query` to see what a file imports and what depends on it before
   diving into its contents. This prevents unnecessary reading of transitive dependencies.
   - **Before modifying or deleting a file**, check its dependents with `codebase_graph_query`
     to understand the blast radius.
   - **When planning a refactor**, use the graph to identify all affected files before
     making changes.

3. **Use Impact Analysis BEFORE refactoring, renaming, or deleting code.**
   The symbol-level call graph (`codebase_impact`, `codebase_flow`, `codebase_symbol`,
   `codebase_symbols`) goes one step deeper than the file graph: it knows which
   functions and methods call which.
   - `codebase_impact` answers "what breaks if I change X?" (blast radius — every file
     that transitively calls into the target).
   - `codebase_flow` answers "what does this code do?" by tracing forward from an entry
     point. Call with no `entrypoint` to discover candidate entry points (auto-detected
     via orphans, conventional names like `main()`, framework routes, tests).
   - `codebase_symbol` gives a 360° view of one function: definition, callers, callees.
   - `codebase_symbols` lists symbols in a file or searches by name.
   - Always prefer these over reading multiple files when the question is about
     dependencies between functions, not concepts.

4. **Read files only after narrowing down via search.**
   Once search results clearly point to 1–3 files, read only the relevant sections.
   Never read a file just to find out if it's relevant — search first.

5. **Use `codebase_graph_circular` when debugging unexpected behaviour.**
   Circular dependencies cause subtle runtime issues; check for them proactively.
   Also run `codebase_graph_circular` when you notice import-related errors or unexpected
   initialisation order.

6. **Leverage context artifacts for non-code knowledge.**
   Projects can define a `.socraticodecontextartifacts.json` config to expose database
   schemas, API specs, infrastructure configs, architecture docs, and other project
   knowledge that lives outside source code. These artifacts are auto-indexed alongside
   code during `codebase_index` and `codebase_update`.
   - Run `codebase_context` early to see what artifacts are available.
   - Use `codebase_context_search` to find specific schemas, endpoints, or configs
     before asking about database structure or API contracts.
   - If `codebase_status` shows artifacts are stale, run `codebase_context_index` to
     refresh them.

### Quick Tool Selection Table

| Goal | Tool |
|------|------|
| Check if current project is indexed | `codebase_status` |
| Start indexing an unindexed project | `codebase_index` $\rightarrow$ poll `codebase_status` |
| Understand what a codebase does / where a feature lives | `codebase_search` (broad query) |
| Find a specific function, constant, or type | `codebase_search` (exact name) or grep if exact string |
| Find exact error messages, log strings, or regex patterns | grep / ripgrep |
| See what a file imports or what depends on it | `codebase_graph_query` |
| Check blast radius before modifying or deleting a file | `codebase_impact` (symbol-level) or `codebase_graph_query` (file-level) |
| **What breaks if I change function X?** | `codebase_impact target=X` |
| **What does this entry point actually do?** | `codebase_flow entrypoint=X` |
| **List entry points in this codebase** | `codebase_flow` (no args) |
| **Who calls this function and what does it call?** | `codebase_symbol name=X` |
| **What functions/classes exist in this file?** | `codebase_symbols file=path` |
| **Search for symbols by name across the project** | `codebase_symbols query=X` |
| Spot architectural problems | `codebase_graph_circular`, `codebase_graph_stats` |
| Visualise module structure | `codebase_graph_visualize` |
| Discover non-code project knowledge (schemas, specs, configs) | `codebase_context` |
| Find database tables, API endpoints, infra configs | `codebase_context_search` |
