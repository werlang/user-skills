| [`animate-to-intrinsic-sizes`](../guides/css/animate-to-intrinsic-sizes.md) | Animate to Intrinsic Sizes | Animating elements to dynamic sizes like `block-size: auto` or `inline-size: max-content` has historically required JavaScript or fragile "max-height" hacks. |

| [`individual-transform-properties`](../guides/css/individual-transform-properties.md) | Individual Transform Properties | The `transform` property allows you to apply multiple transformations in a specified order, but any changes to a single transformation require re-specifying the entire transformation chain. |
| [`overflow-clipping-control`](../guides/css/overflow-clipping-control.md) | Overflow Clipping Control | While `overflow: hidden` is a "blunt instrument" that almost always clips content strictly at the padding-box, `overflow: clip` combined with `overflow-clip-margin` provides the "scalpel" for fine-grained layout control  |
| [`reduce-style-repetition`](../guides/css/reduce-style-repetition.md) | Reduce Style Repetition with CSS Functions | Maintaining large stylesheets often leads to repetitive logic, especially when dealing with design system tokens like gradients or responsive layout patterns. |

| [`size-aware-styling`](../guides/css/size-aware-styling.md) | Size Aware Styling | Size-aware styling allows components to change their layout or appearance based on the space available to them, rather than the size of the whole screen. |
| [`style-parent-with-has`](../guides/css/style-parent-with-has.md) | Style a Form Group When a Field Is Invalid with :has() | Often, an error state requires styling elements *outside* the input itself—for example, changing the color of a parent `fieldset` border, highlighting the `<label>`, or showing a global error icon in the card header. |
| [`usage-aware-component-variations`](../guides/css/usage-aware-component-variations.md) | Semantic Component Adaptation | Use style queries (`@container style()`) to trigger contextual variations without hardcoding what produces or reacts to each context. |
