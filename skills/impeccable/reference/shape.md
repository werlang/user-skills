# Shape

Discover what should be made and how it should work, then return a confirmed design brief without code.

## Phase 1: Discovery interview

Do not write code or choose visual direction yet.

### Cadence

- Use the structured question tool when available; otherwise ask and stop.
- Ask two or three related questions per round, then wait. One round is the default; add a second only when the answers expose a material gap.
- Do not dump a questionnaire, repeat settled facts, or turn obvious facts into menus. Assert the likely reading and invite correction.
- A sparse prompt requires at least one answer round. A precise prompt may need only a compact confirmation.

### Round 1: purpose, people, and outcome

Choose the two or three questions that most change the result:

- What is this surface or feature for, and what problem must it solve?
- Who specifically reaches it, in what situation and state of mind?
- What is the primary thing they must understand or do? What would success look like?
- What is uniquely true here that a neighboring product or generic template could not claim?

### Round 2: material, behavior, and boundaries

Run only for material unresolved decisions:

- What real content, evidence, data, and assets must the experience carry? What are realistic minimum, typical, and maximum ranges?
- Which states and transitions matter: first-run, empty, loading, error, success, permissions, overflow, or expert use?
- What is the intended fidelity, breadth, and interactivity: exploration, production-ready screen, full flow, or broader surface?
- What must remain untouched? What would make the result feel wrong even if it looked polished?
- Which platform, framework, performance, accessibility, localization, or delivery constraints are binding?

Never ask for CSS values or canned aesthetic lanes. `frontend-design` owns
visual-world and concept choices.

## Phase 2: Resolve the creative direction

When visual direction is unresolved, follow
[creative-handoff.md](creative-handoff.md) and load `frontend-design`. Pass the
discovery facts, established visual authority, constraints, and anti-goals.
Receive one creative direction contract; do not create a second concept inside
Shape.

Skip delegation when the user, DESIGN.md, or an already confirmed contract
settles the direction. Shape still owns the task, state, interaction, and
technical-constraint portions of the brief.

## Phase 3: Write the brief

Write the smallest useful brief:

1. **Job and audience:** who arrives, their context, need, and visitor mode.
2. **Outcome and proof:** primary task/action, success, real evidence, and product-specific truth.
3. **Creative direction:** reference or include the approved
   `frontend-design` contract; do not reinterpret it.
4. **Scope and boundaries:** fidelity, breadth, interactivity, named target, what remains untouched, and explicit anti-goals.
5. **States and ranges:** realistic content/data ranges and material states.
6. **Interaction and layout:** hierarchy, topology, responsiveness, affordances, feedback, and transitions; intent, not CSS.
7. **Constraints and open decisions:** platform, delivery, accessibility, localization, reusable components, and choices a builder must not invent.

Use three to five bullets when the task is settled; use the full structure only for ambiguous, multi-screen, or standalone planning. Do not restate the conversation.

## Confirm and stop

Present the combined brief for explicit confirmation or one correction round,
then stop. Shape never writes code. `frontend-design` owns correction of the
creative contract; Shape owns correction of task, states, interaction, scope,
and constraints.

When no human or structured answer mechanism exists, mark assumptions plainly, return the brief, and stop.
